# CS330 Course Project 
## Description 
This project is to develop a simple TCP-based client server application. TCP client/server will communicate over the network and exchange data. The server will start in passive mode listening for a transmission from the client. The client will then start and contact the server (on a given IP address and port number). The user of the client application types in a word that will be sent to the server; the server will send back a copy of the word.
If the server is down then the client must display an error message.
If server is running, then the client will ask the user to select one of the options:
1) open mode
2) secure mode
3) quit application
